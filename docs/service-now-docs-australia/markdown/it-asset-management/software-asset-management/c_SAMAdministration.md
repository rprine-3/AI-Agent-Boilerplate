# Software Asset Management administration

Software Asset Management administration tasks include adding custom part number records and custom license metrics. You can also refresh processor definitions and migrate software installations. Software Asset Management content service can be enabled, and migration procedures are also included.

The sam\_admin role is required to configure administrative tasks. However, the sam\_user role can view and read configurations.

Software Asset Management job results show the status of discovery model normalization and software usage import jobs.

Software Asset Job Results records are listed in the navigation path **All** &gt; **Software Asset** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Job Results** \(see table for field descriptions\).

|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Number|Number of the job result that is generated when the job is run.|
|Name|Name of the job.|
|Status|Status of the job.|
|Created|Date and time job was created.|
|Updated|Date and time job was updated.|
