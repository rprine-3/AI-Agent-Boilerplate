# Managed IT Resource types

There are five IT Resource categories in ServiceNow Software Asset Management - Server, End User Computing Device, SaaS Subscription User, PaaS Resources, and IaaS Storage.

-   Server is any physical or virtual server that is represented as a configuration item \(CI\) in the CMDB tables listed in the following license resource categories and managed by the Software Asset Management application.
-   End User Computing Device is any physical or virtual non-server CI in the CMDB tables listed in the following license resource categories and managed by the Software Asset Management application.
-   SaaS Subscription User is any unique User Principal name in the SaaS Subscription User table listed in the following license resource categories and managed by the Software Asset Management application.
-   PaaS Resources are cloud-based platform services that are represented as a CI in the CMDB tables listed in the following license resource categories and managed by the Software Asset Management application.
-   IaaS Storage is any cloud-based infrastructure service represented as a CI in a CMDB table listed in the following license resource categories and managed by the Software Asset Management application.

Servers and End User Computing Devices are managed by the Software Asset Management application when the installed software on the Managed IT Resources is represented in the Software Installation \[cmdb\_sam\_sw\_install\] table.
