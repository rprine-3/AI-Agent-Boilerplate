# Upload the IBM software discovery catalog to your ServiceNow instance

Upload the IBM software discovery catalog to your ServiceNow instance so that discovery tools, such as the ServiceNow® Discovery application, can identify the IBM software that is discovered in your environment.

## Before you begin

Role required: sam\_admin

## About this task

The IBM software discovery catalog is a centralized repository of IBM software information that discovery tools can use to identify discovered IBM software. This catalog is maintained separately by each Authorized Software Asset Management Provider \(ASP\).

## Procedure

1.  Download the IBM software discovery catalog from the ASP that you are integrating with.

2.  Upload the catalog to your ServiceNow instance.

    1.  From your ServiceNow instance, navigate to **All** &gt; **Software Asset** &gt; **Administration** &gt; **Import IBM Content**.

    2.  On the Manage Software Library form, select **Attach Content File**.

        The Attachments dialog box opens.

    3.  In the dialog box, select **Choose file** to search for and select the IBM software discovery catalog that you downloaded from the ASP.

    4.  Close the dialog box to return to the Manage Software Library form.

    5.  Select **Run Import**.


## Result

If you are integrating with Anglepoint, all IBM software information that is included in the catalog is stored in the following Software Asset Management tables:

-   Anglepoint File Names \[samp\_anglepoint\_file\_name\]
-   Anglepoint File Maps \[samp\_anglepoint\_file\_map\]
-   Anglepoint File Sets \[samp\_anglepoint\_file\_set\]

**Note:** These tables are extensions of the base File Names \[samp\_file\_name\], File Maps \[samp\_file\_map\], and File Sets \[samp\_file\_set\] tables. To extend the base tables, you must request and install Anglepoint's IBM Licensing for Software Asset Management application. See [Request Anglepoint's IBM Licensing for Software Asset Management application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/it-asset-management/software-asset-management/request-anglepoint-application.md) for detailed instructions.
