# SaaS overview dashboard in workspace

View all SaaS related analytics for pure SaaS, Microsoft Office 365, and Adobe Cloud in the SaaS overview dashboard in the Software asset analytics view.

Optimize your organization's cost on SaaS by analyzing the subscription usage, cost, and compliance for your SaaS applications on the SaaS overview dashboard. You can also view compliance analysis results related to Microsoft Office 365 and Adobe Cloud.

**Note:** The SaaS overview dashboard is only visible if you activate the Software Asset Management - SaaS License Management plugin from ServiceNow Store.

You can filter the dashboard by instance, publisher, software model, or domain. Select any report to see more information.

**Note:** The Domain filter narrows your results based on the domain that you select. The default value for the domain filter is global. You can select a domain at any given time for widgets to reflect the selected domain. After you clear the selected domain, it defaults back to global. The Domain filter appears on the screen only if the following plugins are installed:

-   Domain Support - Domain Extensions Installer \(com.glide.domain.msp\_extensions.installer\)
-   Performance Analytics - Domain Support \(com.snc.pa.domain\_support\)

You can access the SaaS overview dashboard by navigating to **Workspaces** &gt; **Software Asset Workspace** &gt; **Software asset analytics**.
