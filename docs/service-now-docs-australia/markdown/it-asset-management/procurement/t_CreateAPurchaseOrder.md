# Create a purchase order

You can create a purchase order. Purchase orders specify assets to order from a single vendor.

## Before you begin

Role required: procurement\_admin or procurement\_user

## About this task

For example, an organization can create a purchase order to buy 20 laptop computers or 10 servers. Information on a purchase order enables physical and financial tracking of the assets that were ordered.

You can also use a transfer order if an asset is already owned by an organization. A transfer order is used to internally transfer assets from one stockroom to another instead of purchasing the assets. For example, a company stockroom in New York has five laptops that are needed in Boston. You create a transfer order to move the laptops from the New York stockroom to the Boston stockroom.

After you create a purchase order, the **Receiving Slip** related list is available on the Purchase Order form. A receiving slip is created manually or automatically when the item is received. The **Receiving Slip** related list shows all receiving slips related to the purchase order. After a receiving slip is added to a purchase order, all fields on the purchase order record become read-only.

## Procedure

1.  Navigate to **All** &gt; **Procurement** &gt; **Orders** &gt; **Purchase Orders**.

2.  Click **New**.
