# Sourcing items in a service catalog request

A service catalog request can contain multiple items that must be sourced.

**Note:** Only items with an assigned model can be sourced. You can’t source bundles.

## Sourcing requested items from local stockrooms

You can use the assets available in the requester’s local stockroom to fulfill a service catalog request. The assets that are in stock are reserved and a fulfillment task is created to source and fulfill the request.

## Sourcing requested items from other stockrooms

When the requested items aren’t in stock, you can create a purchase order to deliver the items from other source stockrooms to your local stockroom. You can request multiple items in a purchase order.

After creating a purchase order, you can create hardware assets and reserve it for the requester either before or after you receive the requested items. You can’t create or assign software licenses to the requester before you receive the software licenses.

## Sourcing requested hardware items

You can source requested hardware items by creating a transfer order. You can transfer hardware assets from a source stockroom to multiple destination stockrooms.

When a source stockroom doesn’t have enough items in stock, you can specify multiple source stockrooms in the transfer order so that the hardware items can be transferred to the destination stockrooms.

**Important:** If the Field Service Management application is also activated on your ServiceNow instance, then a workflow in this application processes the transfer orders. For more information, see [Move an asset through the transfer process](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/field-service-management/create-transfer-order-line-task.md).

## Sourcing requested software licenses

To source a requested software license, you must assign the rights of the software license to a user or a device so that they’re authorized to use the software.
