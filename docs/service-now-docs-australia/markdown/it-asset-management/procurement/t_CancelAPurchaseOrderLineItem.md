## About this task

Keep the following in mind when you cancel a purchase order line item.

-   If you cancel a purchase order line item for which assets were created, the assets are deleted from the system and removed from the purchase order.
-   If you reorder the same purchase order line item, the assets are recreated for that line if the line has a status of **Pending Delivery**.
