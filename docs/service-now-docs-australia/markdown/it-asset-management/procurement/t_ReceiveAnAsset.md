When assets are received and delivered to a stockroom, they’re added to the system.

## Before you begin

Role required: procurement\_admin or procurement\_user

## About this task

When you receive assets:

-   If you haven’t pre-created hardware assets, you can enter asset details and reserve them for users.
-   You can over receive an order wherein, the received quantity can be higher than the ordered quantity.
-   If you have ordered multiple items with different receiving stockrooms, you can receive them at the same time.

</table>2.  Select a purchase order with a **Status** of **Ordered** or **Pending Delivery**.

3.  Select **Receive**.

    The Receive Purchase Order screen appears with the list of the products ordered.

4.  Select the **Received** check box for the line items that you’re receiving.

5.  To receive software assets:

    1.  Edit the **Receiving Stockroom** if the items arrived at a different stockroom than the one specified on the purchase order.

    2.  Edit the **Receiving Quantity** if the number of items delivered doesn't match the number ordered.

    3.  Edit the **Unit Cost** if the price changed between the time the item was ordered and the time it arrived at the stockroom.

        Enter a number. The number can include decimals.

    4.  Select **Capture Asset tags** to enter asset details.

        You can't enter details for assets more than the received rights.

    5.  In the **Capture Asset Tag** dialog box, select **Insert a new row**.

    6.  Enter the asset tag, serial number, rights, and License key.

6.  To receive hardware, consumables, and enterprise assets:

    1.  Edit the **Receiving Stockroom** if the items arrived at a different stockroom than the one specified on the purchase order.

        **Note:** The asset bundle when received creates the asset bundle with the status as **Bundle**. You must add the individual assets under the asset bundle.

    2.  Edit the **Receiving Quantity** if the number of items delivered doesn’t match the number ordered.

    3.  Select the **Reserve** toggle button to reserve the item.

        When a reserved item is received, the **State** and **Substate** fields on the corresponding asset record are automatically set to **In stock** and **Reserved**, respectively. If the **Reserve** button isn’t selected for an item, the **State** and **Substate** fields on the corresponding asset record are set to **In stock** and **Available**.

        **Note:** You can’t reserve consumables.

    4.  From the **Reserved for** list, select a user you want reserve the asset for.

        If a name was specified in the **Requested for** field on the Purchase order line item form, the name is added automatically but can be changed.

        You can add multiple users in the **Capture Asset tags** dialog box.

    5.  Select **Capture asset tags** to enter asset details.

        You can’t enter details for assets more than the received quantity. You can also reserve assets for a user.

        **Note:** If you’ve pre-created the assets, you must select the ones you want to receive.

        The **Capture asset tags** dialog box appears with the following fields to be filled in:

        -   **Asset Tag**
        -   **Serial number**
        -   **MAC address**
        -   **Reserved for**
        If you have activated the Enterprise Asset Management or OT Asset Management application, then the **MAC address** field is also displayed.

    6.  In the **Capture asset tags** dialog box, select **Insert a new row**.

    7.  Enter the asset details that are required to proceed with receiving the assets.

        If the assets that you are receiving belong to model categories linked to a CI class with identification rules defined for fields like the Asset tag, Serial number, or MAC address, you should provide details for at least one of these fields. For example, if identification rules are defined for the Serial number and MAC address, you should provide a value for either of these fields to proceed. The Capture asset tags dialog box will display a message indicating the specific field values you should provide.

        The identification rules for a CI class are defined in the CMDB Identification and Reconciliation engine \(IRE\). For more details, see [Identification rules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/c_IdentificationRules.md) and [Create a CI identification rule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceNow/ServiceNowDocs/australia/markdown/servicenow-platform/t_CreateCIIdentificationRule.md). These rules help to uniquely identify the asset through these required fields and maintain accurate asset records.

    8.  From the **Reserved for** list, select the user for whom the item was ordered.

        If a name was specified in the **Requested for** field on the Purchase order line item form, the name is added automatically, but you can change it.

    9.  Edit the **Unit Cost** if the price changed between the time the item was ordered and the time it arrived at the stockroom.

        Enter a number. The number can include decimals.

7.  Select **Submit**.

    A confirmation message displays with the details of assets received.

8.  Select **OK**.

    A receiving slip is automatically created and can be viewed in the **Receiving Slips** related list. If items on a purchase order are received at different times, a new receiving slip is created each time any item on the purchase order is received. For example, if 30 laptop computers were ordered and arrived in three separate shipments, three receiving slips are created.

    Different assets are created for each hardware item. If it’s a software asset, one single asset is created for each license if you don't split the rights. For consumables, if an asset exists, it’s updated, or else, new assets are created.
